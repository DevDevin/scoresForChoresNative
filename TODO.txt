-- try to get back buttons (maybe use back handler)
-- beautify the style and design
-- fix login feature
-- change appearance of rewards if requested.
	- reward request
-- undo reward request
-- undo completion request 
-- change side menu icons
-- make edit forms scroll view. 
-- delete chores/rewards
-- remove unused imports
-- action button disapears when scrolling
-- make the input views look nicer.
-- if same reward request exists multiple times they will all be removed when accepting or rejecting. 
	- need to make the reward id unique. Maybe I can generate a random Id.
