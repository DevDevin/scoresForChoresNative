-- try to get back buttons (maybe use back handler)
-- beautify the style and design
-- fix login feature
-- delete chores/rewards
-- make the input views look nicer
-- if same reward request exists multiple times they will all be removed when accepting or rejecting. 
	- need to make the reward id unique. Maybe I can generate a random Id.
-- matching passwords when user created
