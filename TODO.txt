-- beautify the style and design 
-- make all the forms like the sign in form in style
-- remove the auto filled values from the form like email and password
-- fix the back arrow navigation. 
	- use the componentWillUnmount lifecycle method with an actions call like in ChildRewardStore.js
	- consider using react-native BackHandler
-- user profile cancel button for children navigates to parent reward list
-- make it so back button won't log out of that user. Maybe disable the back button at the child 
	and parent home
