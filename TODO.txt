-- try to get back buttons (maybe use back handler)
-- beautify the style and design
-- fix login feature
*-- change appearance of rewards if requested.
	- check each reward to see if that reward exists as a reward request with that current users name. 
	- if so, then change the appearance of the reward. 
*-- undo reward request
-- change side menu icons
-- delete chores/rewards
-- make the input views look nicer.
-- if same reward request exists multiple times they will all be removed when accepting or rejecting. 
	- need to make the reward id unique. Maybe I can generate a random Id.
